## Purpose
A sandbox in which I'm learning DOTS. Kept here for reference. You can find the projects under `Assets/Examples`

## Projects
**Noise map**  
Here are a few thousand cubes on a plane

Here is a bad attempt at mapping them to a sphere

**Boids**  
about 2500 boids. Going higher kills performance due to hybrid renderer but I didn't attempt to optimize that (nor set rendering up correctly, one step at a time)
